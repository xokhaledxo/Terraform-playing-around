# This is my modest Terraform plying around repo!
In this mini project I will be doing some basic configs using Terraform and AWS
**I will be doing the following:**

* creating an EC2 instance and deploy it on a custom VPC, custom subnet. 
*  Assign it a public IP address, so that we can ssh furthermore 
*  we can automatically set up a web server to run on it so we can handle a web traffic
